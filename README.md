 <summary>dc_shell </summary>
I invoked dc_shell using the following commands: dc_shell

dc_shell is used for RTL (Register Transfer Level) synthesis, which involves transforming a high-level hardware description (often written in languages like Verilog or VHDL) into a gate-level representation that can be used for further steps in the chip design process. It optimizes the design for factors like area, power, and timing, helping to generate an efficient gate-level netlist that meets the specified design constraints.

 <summary>gtk_wave </summary>
I invoked gtkwave using the following command: gtkwave

With gtkwave, designers can visualize the behavior of their digital designs over time. It allows user to load and display simulation output files, often in formats like Value Change Dump (VCD) or Signal List (SL), which contain information about how signals change over simulation cycles.

By visualizing waveforms, designers can identify issues such as incorrect logic behavior, timing violations, or unexpected signal transitions, helping them debug and validate their designs more effectively.Below is the screenshot showing sucessful launch:

 <summary>iverilog </summary>
I invoked Icarus Verilog using the following commands: iverilog

iverilog allows user to write Verilog code to describe digital circuits, and then it can simulate the behavior of those circuits to help the user catch and fix bugs before manufacturing. It's often used for tasks like functional verification, testbench development, and even simple logic synthesis for small designs.

# Day-1 Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis
<details>
 <summary>  Introduction to open-source simulator iverilog</summary>
	
RTL Design : It is a set of codes that has actual intended functionality to meet with the required specifications.
This design's relevence to the specifications, is checked through simulation.

Test Bench: It is a set of stimulus that is applied as input, so that output can be checked with required specifications.

<img width="1085" alt="testbench" 
src="https://github.com/SakshithVarambally/Samsung_PD_Training/blob/9e9b2ccf08d08d98cf3391071bc9e8cdf23bdb25/Test_bench.png">

Iverilog simulates the design with testbench and gives a vcd file as an output.

vcd : Value change dump format

gtkwave is used to see the waveforms of output corresponding to input to verify the functionality of the design.

my_lib : Contains all the standard cells which are presnt as .lib extension.

verilog_files : Contains all designs, source files and testbench files.

These are the commands used to load and execute the simulation 

iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v    /Loads the corresponding verilog and testbench file
./a.out                              /Dumps the vcd file
gtkwave tb_goodmux.vcd               /loads the corresponding waveform

<summary> Introduction to Yosys and Logic synthesis </summary> </summary>
Yosys is a tool used for converting RTL to netlist

The following commands are used in the simulation

read_verilog    #reads the verilog design

read_liberty    #reads .lib file

write_verilog   #create output netlist

.lib contains different flavours of gates(slow, medium, fast etc)
Combination delay in logic path determines the max speed of operation of digital logic circuit.

Fclk = 1/Tclk
More the clock speed, better is the performance

Tradeoff between different cells;  
Load in digital circuit is represnted by capacitance.
To charge/discharge the capacitance fast, we need transistors capable of sourcing more current -> wide transistors, low delay but more area and power.

Narrow transistors are used for less Area and power but more delay

Hence an ideal trade off is to be performed with the usage of different cells as per the requirement and specifications that are intended.

commands used for synthesis

read_verilog                          #reads the verilog design
read_liberty                          #reads .lib file
synth -top good_mux    
abc -liberty ../lib/<lib name>        #Converts rtl to netlist, gates from .lib
write_verilog                         #create output netlist 

The result shows the consolidated no of different gates being used in the netlist and the no of inputs and outputs.


write_verilog -noattr
-noattr reduces the netlist size by deleting the additional information attatched to the design elements making the netlist compact.

The below screenshot shows the synthesised netlist of a good_mux i.e a 2:1 Mux
