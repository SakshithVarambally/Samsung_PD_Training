## Day-1

<details>
 <summary> Introductio toto Verilog RTL design and Synthesis</summary>
RTL Design : It is a set of codes that has actual intended functionality to meet with the required specifications..
If this design is relevent or not to the specifications, is checked through simulation

Test Bench: It is a set of stimulus that is applied as input, so that output can be checked with required specifications.

Iverilog simulates the design with testbench and gives a vcd file as an output.
vcd : Value change dump format
gtkwave is used to see the waveforms of output corresponding to input to verify the functionality of the design.
